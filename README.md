# logistic regression classifier to recognize cats
We will be building a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats (meow!).
This project will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset,
and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning. By the end, you'll be able to classify your own photo as cat/not cat (meow?).
